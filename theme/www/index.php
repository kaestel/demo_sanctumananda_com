				<div class="c60 align-left">
					<p>
						Sanctum Ananda literally means <span>a private place</span> of <span>joy, bliss, happiness</span>. And that is exactly what it is
						intended to be. A place, where everything suddenly makes sense, becomes all worth it, and where you have
						this strong feeling of having arrived. In every possible way.
					</p>
					<p>
						More specifically, Sanctum Ananda is an exclusive portfolio of small luxury holiday retreats in selected
						sought after locations around the world. Upcoming locations include Mallorca, mainland Spain, the South of
						France, the Mediterranean coast of Italy, the Greek islands, the Algarve coast of Portugal, and Tulum in
						Mexico.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each Sanctum Ananda retreat is made up of a selection of Villas and Suites. Villas come with a fully
						equipped kitchen, a dining- and living area, and a luxury bedroom and bathroom. Suites feature bedrooms
						and bathrooms identical to those found in Villas, and also a small bar/kitchenette. Both Villas and Suites
						come with their own generous private terrace and pool, and both are of an extremely luxurious specification.
						Villas sleep up to four people, Suites sleep two. A Villa is twice the physical size of a Suite.
					</p>
					<p>Both Villas and Suites come fully furnished and air-conditioned and can be stocked to your specific requirements on arrival.</p>

					<h3>Ownership</h3>

					<p class="quote">
						”... investors will always be 100% in the money from day one”
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="c60 align-right">
					<p>
						All Sanctum Ananda retreats are owned by their users. As an example, if a given Sanctum Ananda retreat
						requires a total investment of “100” to establish and an investor invests “10”, then that investor would own
						10% of the retreat. Simple.
					</p> 
					<p>
						In practical terms and depending on local circumstances, each retreat will likely be owned by a commercial
						vehicle, typically a registered company, and each investor would then own a share of this vehicle.	
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the traditional benefits of property ownership, purchase of a share in a Sanctum Ananda retreat
						allows each investor an annual amount of expenditure towards free stays in proportion to the amount
						invested. In other words, the bigger your share, the more time you and your family and friends will be
						entitled to spend free of charge.
					</p>
					<p>
						Importantly, no Sanctum Ananda retreat will ever carry any debt and investors will always be 100% in the
						money from day one as no fees are charged on top of the actual cost to develop. Like this, the total amount
						invested will be on par with the market value of each retreat from the outset.

					<h3>Capacity</h3>

					<p class="quote">
						“... all a shareholder will ever have to pay to stay at a Sanctum Ananda
						retreat, is for cleaning in connection with actual stays”
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="c60 align-left">
					<p>
						As a central feature of the concept, each Sanctum Ananda retreat is scaled such that its capacity exceeds the
						expected collective requirements of its owners, even during peak season. In other words, shareholders can
						generally expect to be able to book whatever they want whenever they want it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The excess capacity of each retreat is exclusively managed by the Sanctum Ananda organisation which rents
						it out for profit, but in return undertakes, to manage and pay for all upkeep and maintenance. Like this, save
						for local taxes, which are covered out of each shareholder’s annual amount for expenditure, all a shareholder
						will ever have to pay to stay at a Sanctum Ananda retreat, is for cleaning in connection with actual stays.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a further benefit, shareholders enjoy unrestricted access to the Sanctum Ananda booking system whereas
						the general public will only be able to book a stay a maximum of three months in advance.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are also no restrictions such as a minimum required duration or mandatory amount of accomodation
						per stay. Need a Villa and two Suites for a group of eight for 12 days? Book that. A single Suite for a
						weekend or a midweek stay for two? Book that. You can always book exactly what you need, and you always
						only pay for exactly what you book. The level of luxury, however, remains the same regardless of the length
						of your stay and the size of your share.

				<div class="c60 align-right">
					<p>
						Purchase of a share in a Sanctum Ananda retreat affords the investor full and immediate access to them
						all. Like this, even if your particular Sanctum Ananda retreat has yet to be developed, you can go and enjoy
						any of the other retreats as soon as you are invested.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are also no limits in terms of how you wish to distribute your stays; you can go to your favourite retreat
						every time all the time, or mix it up however you please. You can choose to spend your full allowance all at
						once or spread it more evenly over the year. Where and when you wish to go should be up to you. Fully up to
						you. And it is.
					</p>
					<p>
						Bigger share, more stays for free. All shares, same Sanctum Ananda experience.

					“As an added benefit at the end of each year, 
					investors are offered the opportunity to redeem unused credit for cash”
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="c60 align-left">
					<p>
						Shares are currently available from €150,000 and upwards in further increments of €50,000 and shareholders
						are awarded an annual amount towards free stays at all Sanctum Ananda retreats of 10% of their investment.
						As such, an investment of €250,000 would provide its investor with an annual amount of €25,000 towards
						free stays.
					</p>
					<p>
						As an added benefit, at the end of each year, shareholders are offered the opportunity to redeem unused credit
						for cash at a 50% discount – for example:
					</p>
					<p>
						You invest €250,000 and receive an annual amount towards free stays of €25,000, but by the end of the year,
						you have only spent €15,000. You may now either hold on to the remaining €10,000 for coming years or
						redeem €5,000 in cash since the Sanctum Ananda organisation would have profited from renting out the
						excess capacity you have provided by not using your full allowance.
					</p>
					<p>
						Like this and although we sincerely hope you will choose to enjoy the full range of retreats, if you were to
						invest purely for financial purposes, a share in a Sanctum Ananda retreat would yield you a fixed return of
						5% per year before tax.
					</p>
					<p>
						Investors are free to sell on their shares at any time giving potential new investors the opportunity to become
						shareholders without having to wait for the next Sanctum Ananda retreat to be developed.
					</p>
					<p>
						As more retreats are added, share values would be expected to increase not only in proportion with the value
						of the underlying property, but also as further retreats provide additional benefits of ownership to both
						existing and future shareholders.
